# ReqAOC Usage Guide

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:req_aoc, github: "mcrumm/req_aoc", ref: "eef58c9"}
])
```

## Input

This guide provides a starting point for downloading [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) data in Livebook. The first step is to configure `AOC_SESSION` in your **app secrets**, which requires Livebook v0.7+. Run the following block and click 'Add Secret' when prompted:

```elixir
input =
  System.fetch_env!("LB_AOC_SESSION")
  |> ReqAOC.fetch!({2022, 01}, max_retries: 0)
```
## How to get your session cookie

Puzzle inputs differ by user. For this reason, you can't get your data with an unauthenticated request. Here's how to get your session cookie for ReqAOC to use:

* Log in on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) via any available provider.
* Open your browser's developer console (e.g. right click --> Inspect) and navigate to the Network tab.
* GET any input page, for example https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1/input, and search in the **request headers**.
* It's a long hex string. You want the part that comes _after_ `Cookie: session=`. Save that to a system environment variable or a Livebook app secret called `AOC_SESSION`.
